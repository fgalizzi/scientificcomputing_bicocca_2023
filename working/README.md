In this folder you find the jupyter notebooks with the exercises I solved for
the exams.
At the beginning of each notebook I declare the 2 excercises for the exams, the extras 
are appended below.
I'd use the Game-of-Life bonus to skip an excercise in Lecture 8.
The python package I wrote is in wf_package.

I'm particularly proud of the names of my Tic-Tac-Toe players (Lecture 1).
