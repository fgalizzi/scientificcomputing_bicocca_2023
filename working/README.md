In this folder you find the jupyter notebooks with the excercise I solved for
the exams.
In general, I solved more excercise than required. At the beginning of each
notebook I declare the excercise for the exams, the extras are appended below
the 2 necessary excercises.
I'd use the Game-of-Life bonus to skip an excercise in Lecture 8.
The python package I wrote is in wf_package.

I'm particularly proud of the names of my Tic-Tac-Toe players (Lecture 1).
